Our project was creating a mobile app for one of the Business INCubator teams at North. Their business is called Style360 that is a personalized clothing swap service. While they already have a website where users can create or log into their accounts and initiate swaps of clothing, they wanted us to make an app that includes similar functions to make the process more convenient for users. Specifically. these functions were signing up/in, viewing the user profile with preferences for clothing style, personal stylist, etc, getting account points by submitting unwanted pieces of clothing, viewing the inventory of clothing that the business warehouse currently carries, and actually initiating a swap from which the user can use account points in exchange for receiving clothing. For this app, we used the programming language React Native because it is compatible for both iOS and Android phones, and used Expo to run the code and phone simulator on the Macs. 

Platform Requirements:
- Atom (our code text editor, can download here - https://atom.io)
- MacOS computer for coding
- Expo (was already on the MacOS computers that we used)
